<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the Privacy Policy of Media Social LLC and Who and its various &amp; next versions including Who web version, “Who go” (collectively hereinafter, “Who”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) and is incorporated into and is subject to our Terms of Use which can be found at <a href="https://trademax.com/terms/" target="_blank">https://trademax.com/terms/</a> In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our products and services as the “Service.” Please read on to learn more about our data handling practices. Your use of the Service signifies that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.
<a href="https://trademax.com/privacy/tos.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service can be found here.</a>
</p>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>

<p>When you install the Service on your device and register with Who, personally identifiable information about you may be collected during the download process for the Service (as requested from you during the download process) when you register with us. For registration through Who, you are required to provide your mobile phone number or your email address, city location, gender, name, depending on the device(s) you are using on the Service. You may also provide personally identifiable information, but that is optional. When you log in using your Facebook account, we may collect additional information you make available to us (see “Your User Profile”) below.
</p>

<p>In addition, when you install the Service on your device and register with Who, you may will be asked to allow us access to your address book. If you consent, we will have access to contact information in your address book on the devices you use for the Service (names, numbers, emails, and Facebook ID, but not notes or other personal information in your address book) and we will store it on our servers and use it to help you use the Service, for example, by synchronizing your Who contacts between different devices you may want to use with the Service. If you do not want Who to store this information, you may opt-out through your account settings in the Who application at any time. However we may not be able to offer some of the features that require this information.
</p>

<p>Who may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable information, such as certain profile information including country of residence and preferences. In addition, Who may collect and store information about your and others’ usage of and interaction with the Service and our websites, including matches, numbers of matches made by members, match durations, text messages, usage by geographies, device and connection information, IP address, device capability, bandwidth, statistics on page views, network type and traffic to and from our websites.
</p>

<p>Who allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications in the Who application with other users, and if you choose to do so your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications will be stored on our servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other Who users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications in the Who application is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). Who is not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.
</p>

<p>Who may also collect and gather user contents (e.g., photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials) that you create on the Service. Your photo can be taken by other users on the Who, and If they use capturing function provided by the Who, those photos can be stored and used for Who and 3rd party’s service(eg, Facebook, etc.). You can change sharing option of 3rd party on the Who settings. If you do not agree with all the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.
</p>

<p>To complete a commerce transaction on Who item shop, you will be requested to provide your payment information, including your credit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. In that event, we will transmit your information securely directly to a third party vendor or merchant who will collect such information in order to process and fulfill your purchase. Who does not process or store your payment information. However, we may store other information about your purchases made on the Service, which may include the merchant’s name, the date, time and amount of the transaction and other behavioral information.
</p>

<p>We also collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes or hangs up so that we can investigate the error and improve the stability of the Service for future releases. In general these reports do not contain personally identifiable information, or only incidentally. As part of these error reports, we receive information about the type and version of your device, the device identifier, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and fixing the error.
</p>

Your Profile is available to other users of the Service who are connected to you on Who. In addition, unless you opt-out (which you may do at any time in the Who application), your Profile is discoverable by other Who users, including by way of example in listings of contacts that will include your proximity to other users. You may also “block out” any Who user in your contact list from discovering your Profile at any time.
